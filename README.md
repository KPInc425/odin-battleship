Finish it up

-Auto add AI ships
-Add attack listeners after ai ships placed


You can polish the intelligence of the computer player by having it try adjacent slots after getting a ‘hit’.


~Optionally~
create a 2 player option that lets users take turns by passing the device back and forth. If you’re going to go this route, make sure the game is playable on a mobile screen and implement a ‘pass device’ screen so that players don’t see each others boards!

give each ship a different outline color

add random ship location button that triggers auto placing of ships (same used for AI)



# Bugs

-unwanted side effects
--No response when trying to place a ship in invalid location
