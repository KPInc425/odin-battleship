You can polish the intelligence of the computer player by having it try adjacent slots after getting a ‘hit’.


Optionally, create a 2 player option that lets users take turns by passing the device back and forth. If you’re going to go this route, make sure the game is playable on a mobile screen and implement a ‘pass device’ screen so that players don’t see each others boards!
